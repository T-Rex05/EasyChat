"""
Skill Manager Tool -- Agent-Managed Skill Creation & Editing

Allows the agent to create, update, and delete skills, turning successful
approaches into reusable procedural knowledge. New skills are created in
~/.hermes/skills/. Existing skills (bundled, hub-installed, or user-created)
can be modified or deleted wherever they live.

Skills are the agent's procedural memory: they capture *how to do a specific
type of task* based on proven experience. General memory (MEMORY.md, USER.md) is
broad and declarative. Skills are narrow and actionable.

Actions:
  create     -- Create a new skill (SKILL.md + directory structure)
  edit       -- Replace the SKILL.md content of a user skill (full rewrite)
  patch      -- Targeted find-and-replace within SKILL.md or any supporting file
  delete     -- Remove a user skill entirely
  write_file -- Add/overwrite a supporting file (reference, template, script, asset)
  remove_file-- Remove a supporting file from a user skill

Directory layout for user skills:
    ~/.hermes/skills/
    ├── my-skill/
    │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   ├── references/
    │   ├── templates/
